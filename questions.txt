Set 3:
  1.) loc1.getRow()
  2.) false
  3.) (4,4)
  4.) 45
  5.) The getAjacentLocation method takes an int variable that will represent the angle.
      So it gets the ajacent location in that direction

Set 4:
  1.) You could loop through each location on a bounded grid with stacked for loops of
      the numRows and numCols and just keep track of how many don't return null when you try to get.
      And you can subtract this from total to find the empty spaces, of count up how many do return null
  2.) you can run the Location (10,10) through the isValid method
  3.) Grid is just an interface. the methods are implemented in BoundedGrid.java and UnboundedGrid.java
  4.) I think it would be a better design to use arrays because they take up less space, but ArrayLists
      have more methods. Also an array had a definate size but an ArrayList can get bigger and smaller which
      is useful depending on what you're returning
      
Set 5:
  1.) Color, Direction, Location
  2.) It is colored Blue and facing North.
  3.) It contains methods and variables that all types of Actors will use, so it makes sense to just write one parent class that it's subclasses can just build off of.
  4.) An actor cannot put itself into a grid twice without first removing itself nor can it be removed from a grid twice. It can however be placed into a grid, remove itself,and then put itself back.
  5.) An Actor can turn 90 degrees to the right by running setDirection on (getDirection + 90);
